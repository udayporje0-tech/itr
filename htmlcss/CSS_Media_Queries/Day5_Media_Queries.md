1. What is a Media Query?

A CSS technique that uses the `@media` rule to include a block of CSS properties 
only if a certain condition is true (such as a specific viewport width).

Syntax structure:-
```css
@media media-type and (media-feature) {
    /* CSS rules apply only when conditions are met */
}
